# Terraform-Series
🚀 15 Days of Terraform – A Complete Hands-on Learning Series
Welcome to 15 Days of Terraform, a practical, beginner-to-advanced series curated by Shaik Hari Sadia Anjum to help you master Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform — the industry-standard tool by HashiCorp.

This repo includes daily PDFs that break down key Terraform concepts, real-world implementations, and DevOps best practices to build scalable, reusable, and multi-cloud infrastructure.
Each PDF is structured for easy daily learning, making it perfect for:

📚 Self-paced learners

💼 Job seekers preparing for DevOps/Cloud interviews

☁️ Cloud Engineers upskilling in IaC
🔥 Why This Series Stands Out:
✅ Beginner-friendly to Advanced Topics
✅ AWS,GCP, and Kubernetes Examples
✅ Real-time Scenarios & Tips from Hands-on Experience
✅ Interview Insights & Best Practices
✅ Clean, Daily PDFs for Structured Learning
